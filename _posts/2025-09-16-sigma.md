Following [^Ivan-Damgard] and some modern notations, I aim to describe a formal definition of a $3$-step interactive
$\Sigma$-protocol with formal proofs. So:

> For an NP relation $\mathcal{R}$ a $\Sigma$-protocol is a $3$-step protocol between the Prover and the Verifier
consisting of three algorithms $\sigma_{com}, \sigma_{resp}, \sigma_{ver}$ with respect to the security parameter
$\lambda$ and with the following definition:
>
> - $\sigma_{com}^\lambda(x, w) \rightarrow (t, i)$: for the public input $x$, and witness $w$ it generates a commitment
  $t$ and some side information $i$;
>
> - $\sigma_{resp}^\lambda(x,w,i,c) \rightarrow s$: for the public input $x$, witness $w$, and side information
  $i$ it generates a response $s$ for the challenge $c \in \{0,1\}^\lambda$;
>
> - $\sigma_{ver}^\lambda(t,c,x,s) \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$: for the public input $x$, the response $s$, the
  challenge $c$, and the commitment $t$ it outputs bit $b \in \{0,1\}$ assuming $(x, w) \in \mathcal{R}$ if $b = 1$
  and $(x, w) \notin \mathcal{R}$ otherwise.

A $\Sigma$-protocol has the following properties:

### Completeness

A $\Sigma$-protocol is said to be complete if for any pair $(x,w)$, such that $(x,w) \in \mathcal{R}$, and any challenge
$c\in \{0,1\}^\lambda$:

$$
Pr\Big[\sigma_{ver}^\lambda(t,c,x,s) = 1\Big] \geq 1 - \mathsf{negl}(\lambda).
$$

### Special Soundness

A $\Sigma$-protocol is said to be special sound if there exists a special polynomial-time extractor function
$\mathcal{E}$ such that for any two given transcripts $(t,c,x,s)$ and $(t,\hat{c},x,\hat{s})$ where $c \neq \hat{c}$ and
$\sigma_{ver}^\lambda(t,c,x,s) = \sigma_{ver}^\lambda(t,\hat{c},x,\hat{s}) = 1$:

$$
Pr\Big[(x,w) \in \mathcal{R} \;\Big|\; w = \mathcal{E}(t,x,c,s,\hat{c},\hat{s})\Big] \geq 1 - \mathsf{negl}(\lambda).
$$

More precisely, it means that for any two random, distinct challenges, the knowledge of the responses for the same
commitment allows the verifier to recover the witness by a polynomial-time algorithm.

It is also said that a $\Sigma$-protocol is $k$-special sound if the above property achieved using $k$ different
challenges.

### Special Honest-Verifier Zero-Knowledge

A $\Sigma$-protocol is said to be special honest-verifier zero-knowledge if there exists a special polynomial-time
simulator function $\mathcal{S}$ that enables the generation of an accepting
transcript by the verifier using selected uniformly and independently a challenge $c \leftarrow \mathbb{F}$ and a
response $s \leftarrow \mathbb{F}$:

$$
Pr\Big[\sigma_{ver}^\lambda(t,c,x,s) = 1\;\Big|\; t = \mathcal{S}(x,c,s) \Big] \geq 1 - \mathsf{negl}(\lambda).
$$

Transcripts $\{(t, c, s)\}$ generated by this process are assumed to be indistinguishable from real
transcripts that appear during the protocol walkthrough between the honest prover and the honest verifier.

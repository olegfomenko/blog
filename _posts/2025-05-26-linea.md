Recently, my team has been working mainly on the launching the Linea L2 stack. It has been a long way, starting from the
investigating the prover code with aim to improve its performance up to launching the whole system.

[Here is](https://github.com/distributed-lab/linea-dev-edition) the docker-compose example that can help any team to
launch their own L2. It also contains the brief overview of the parts Linea consists of.

From my side, Linea made a good impression on myself, their approach in using own arithmetization in a couple with own
proving protocol ([Votex](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1633.pdf)) and Gnark is really novel. I'm proud that my team
became one of the open-source contributors to the Linea.

## Definition 1

The set of all lines in three-dimensional space that pass through the origin is called the **projective plane**. Any
line that passes through the origin and does **not** lie in the $XOY$ plane (i.e., $z \neq 0$) can be associated
with a point $(x, y, 1)$. For a vector $l$ with coordinates $(X, Y, Z)$ where $Z \neq 0$, the corresponding
point has coordinates:

$$
\left(\frac{X}{Z}, \frac{Y}{Z}, 1\right)
$$

Thus, the projective plane can be thought of as the 2D plane $(x, y, 1)$ along with a set of **points at infinity**
formed by vectors lying in the $XOY$ plane.

## Definition 2

A set of points $C$ on the projective plane $P$ of the form:

$$
C = \{(x, y, z) \in P \mid f(x, y, z) = 0\}
$$

is called an **algebraic curve**. If the polynomial $f$ has degree $\deg f = m$, then $C$ is called a **curve of
degree $m$**.

## Bézout’s Theorem

Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be two algebraic curves of degrees $n$ and $m$, respectively. If they have a finite number
of intersection points and are defined over an **algebraically closed field**, then they intersect at exactly $m \cdot
n$ points.

## Definition 3

An **elliptic curve** is a cubic curve in the projective plane over an algebraically closed field $K$, given by a
degree-3 equation with coefficients from $K$, along with a designated **point at infinity**.

The general form of the elliptic curve in affine coordinates is:

$$
E: y^2 + a_1xy + a_3y = x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_4x + a_6
$$

If the curve is defined over a field of characteristic $\neq 2$, we can simplify the equation by a change of variable:

$$
y \rightarrow y - \frac{a_1x + a_3}{2}
$$

resulting in:

$$
E: y^2 = x^3 + Ax^2 + Bx + C
$$

For fields with characteristic $\neq 2$ and $\neq 3$, further substitution:

$$
x \rightarrow x - \frac{A}{3}
$$

gives the **canonical form**:

$$
E: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
$$

## Group Structure

An elliptic curve can be equipped with the structure of an **abelian group**. If $P$ and $Q$ are two points on the
curve, Bézout’s theorem ensures that the line through them intersects the curve at a third point $R$.

Formulas for computing coordinates of resulting points are derived from solving the canonical cubic equation. These
formulas can be found [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve). Using these formulas along with
Bézout’s theorem, one can prove that this operation defines a valid abelian group.

## Hasse’s Theorem

There is no general formula for the number of points on an elliptic curve group. However, Hasse’s theorem provides an
estimate. For an elliptic curve over a finite field $F_q$ (where $q = p^n$ and $p$ is prime), the number of
points $N$ satisfies:

$$
|N - q - 1| \leq 2\sqrt{q}
$$

In cryptography, one selects curves whose group order is the product of large primes. If the primes are too small, the
curve is considered **cryptographically weak**. After selecting such a curve, the largest subgroup (with maximal prime
order) is typically used.

## Security Considerations

For cryptographic use, it is essential that the elliptic curve has **no singular points**. This can be ensured by
checking that the **discriminant** is nonzero:

$$
\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2) \neq 0
$$

Otherwise:

1. If all three roots of $x$ are zero, the equation becomes $E: y^2 = x^3$. Mapping each pair $(x, y) \in E$ to
   $\frac{x}{y}$ gives an isomorphism with the additive group, making the discrete logarithm **trivial**.
2. If the curve has a double root, it takes the form $E: y^2 = x^2(x + a)$ with $a \neq 0$. Then, mapping $(x, y)
   \in E$ to $\frac{y + \alpha x}{y - \alpha x}$ (where $\alpha^2 = a$) gives an isomorphism to a multiplicative
   group, in which solving the discrete log is also **easy** for typical key sizes.

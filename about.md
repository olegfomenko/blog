My journey started in 2019 when I applied for my first job at a bank as a Junior Java Developer (the Spring stack).
After gaining a year of experience, I realized I needed some changes and finally discovered my true passion: building,
or contributing to, systems that make full use of my math skills. Joining
the [Distributed Lab](https://distributedlab.com) team at the end of 2020 was a key decision that defined the direction
of my career.

Now, after 4.5 years of developing non-trivial cryptography protocols and a complicated decentralized backend
architecture, my main ambition is to continue expanding my expertise in cryptography and sharing my knowledge with
anyone interested.

My primary research areas include zkVM, zkEVM, confidential transactions, distributed infrastructure, and BFT consensus
protocols.
